# Openrank Examples

[Openrank](https://docs.openrank.com/) is a platform for running graph algorithms like [eigentrust](https://github.com/Karma3Labs/openrank-sdk), in an effort to provide high quality contextual feeds for applications. You can take any i,j,v graph, such as a wallet (i) sending another wallet (j) a value of 100 USDC (v).
